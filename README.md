# Location Tracker Tool

This tool is designed to track the IP address and location of any user who opens a disguised PDF file. It is useful for educational or ethical testing purposes like phishing simulation, red teaming, or awareness campaigns.


 Features

- Sends a legitimate-looking PDF file.
- When opened, the victim's browser makes a hidden request to your Flask server.
- Logs the victim's IP address and approximate location (city, country).
- Saves all data in `visitor_logs.txt`.

| `legitimate_document.pdf` | Fake PDF to send to the target |
